# Atmosphere

The highest altitude – elevation – on Earth is Mount Everest at 8,848 m \ 29,029 ft above sea level. The lowest point on land is in the Dead Sea – 420 m / 1.377 ft below sea level. The average depth of the global ocean is about 2.5 miles / 4 kilometers. Most volcanoes are hidden under these oceans. Hawaii’s Mauna Kea is a volcano much taller than Mount Everest, and even Earth’s longest mountain range – four times longer than the Andes, Rockies, and Himalayas combined – is underwater at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.

The shape of the Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth’s rotation speed. This makes the shape of Earth approximately an oblate spheroid. The point on the surface farthest from Earth’s center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador.

Depending upon their current orbital positions, either Venus or Mercury are the closest planets to Earth. It has an equatorial radius of 6.371 km / 3.958 mi, and a polar radius of 6.356 km / 3.949 mi, meaning it is not completely spherical but rather bulged at the equator due to rotation.

The diameter of Earth is around 12.742 km / 7.917 mi being the fifth largest planet from the solar system, and the largest of the terrestrial planets (Venus, Mercury, Mars).

The Earth is so big that if it were hallowed, almost 50 moons could fit inside it. Earth has a mass of about 6.6 sextillion tons and a volume of about 260 billion cubic miles / 1 trillion cubic kilometers. It has the biggest mass out of all the terrestrial planets and the greatest density out of all the planets – 5.51 g/cm³. Earth’s mass composition is mostly comprised of iron 32.1%, oxygen 30.1%, silicon 15.1%, magnesium 13.9%, sulphur 2.9%, nickel 1.8 %,  nickel 1.8%, calcium 1.5%, and aluminum 1.4%. The remaining 1.2% consists of trace amounts of other elements.

Orbit and Rotation
The Earth makes a complete rotation on its axis once every 23.9 hours. It takes Earth 265,25 days to complete one trip around the Sun – year. In order for calendars to maintain their consistency with this orbit, every 4 years one day is added – this is called a leap day – as well as a leap year.

Earth’s orbital speed averages 29.78 km/s (107,208 km/h; 66,616 mph), which is fast enough to cover the planet’s diameter in 7 minutes and the distance to the Moon in 4 hours.

Earth has four major main layers: an inner core at the center, an outer core enveloping it, mantle, and crust.

Since it has the greatest density out of all the planets in the solar system – 5.51 g/cm³ – and a gravity of 9.807 m/s² or 1 g the Earth’s core is solid. It is made of iron and nickel about 759 miles / 1.221 kilometers in radius. The temperatures at the core have been estimated to be around 9.800 degrees Fahrenheit / 5.400 degrees Celsius. This is hotter than the surface of the Sun.

Together with the inner core, Earth also has an outer core, with the crust being the mantle and the thickest layer. It is a viscous mixture of molten rock about 1.800 mi / 2.900 km thick and has the consistency of caramel.

The outermost layer – Earth’s crust – goes about 19 mi / 30 km deep on average on land. But at the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 mi / 5 km from the seafloor to the top of the mantle. The crust in a sense floats on the mantle due to lower density.

It is not a solid piece but rather broken up into huge tectonic plates. These plates move, driven by the flow of rock in the mantle that is in turn powered by heat.

The core heats the bottom of the mantle causing convection leading to the warmer material to rise. It takes about 50.000 to 60.000 years for a blob to move a single kilometer.

Though the hot material rises towards the surface, it is blocked by the crust. The magmatic rock pushes on the plates, causing them to slide around slowly.

Over millions of years, the surface geology of the Earth changed dramatically because of this. Where the crust is weaker magma can push its way through thus erupting onto the surface, forming volcanoes.

Because of volcanoes, material wells out creating new land, and they also pump out gas that greatly contributed to Earth’s atmosphere.

The interior of the Earth is very hot – comparable to the surface of the Sun. Most of the heat has remained since the Earth’s formation. As it gained mass it began to contract under its own gravity – the squeezing adding heat to the material. Elements like uranium also contribute to the Earth’s heat as the atoms radioactively decay.

Another source for the heat: dense materials such as iron and nickel that sunk to the center, warming up due to friction.

The surface of the Earth is constantly moving. Molten lava rises from beneath the surface and moves into the gap that is created. The new rock helps push the plates apart and as it cools, it becomes part of the continually regenerating crust.

When the ocean plates meet the continental plates they are forced downward. This creates friction beneath and pressure forces molten rock upward to erupt to the crust as ash and lava.

Many volcanoes formed this way but there is a second type of collision: when two continental plates converge as one plate slides under the other the lighter mass at the surface thrusts and folds upward forming mountain chains.

The third type of plate interaction occurs where plates meet at oblique angles to each other. Pressure and friction between the surfaces prevent slippage and when the tension becomes too great the plates shift, sliding along a fault line. Sometimes, violent tremors result and cause the widespread destruction of an earthquake.

Surface
The surface area of Earth is about 197 million square miles / 510 million square kilometers. Around 71% of the surface is covered by water and 29% by land.

The water is 3% fresh and 97% salted. Of that 3% freshwater, over 2% is frozen in ice sheets and glaciers meaning that less than 1% is freshwater found in lakes, rivers, and the underground.

In regards to land, the continent of Asia covers about 30% of all the land, having around 60% of the world’s population. The Earth is divided into 7 continents that constantly “move” several centimeters every year. In about 250 million years about four fundamental scenarios for the formation of the next supercontinent have been hypothesized: Novopangea, Pangea Ultima, Aurica and Amasia. 

Novopangea seems the most likely scenario based on current evaluations. The Americas would collide with the northward drifting Antarctica, and then into the already collided Africa-Eurasia.
